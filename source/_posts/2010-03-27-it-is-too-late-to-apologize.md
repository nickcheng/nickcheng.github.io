老婆看Gossip Girl的时候, 我听到一首不错的歌儿. 特意找来多听了几遍, 顺便share给大家.

> Apologize - Timbaland
>
> I'm holding on your rope,  
Got me ten feet off the ground  
And I'm hearing  what you say but I just can't make a sound  
You tell me that you need  me  
Then you go and cut me down, but wait  
You tell me that you're  sorry  
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...  
  
>That it's too late to  apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too  late  
  
>I'd take another chance, take a fall  
Take a shot for you  
And I  need you like a heart needs a beat  
But it's nothing new - yeah yeah  
  
>I  loved you with the fire red-  
Now it's turning blue, and you  say...  
&quot;Sorry&quot; like the angel heaven let me think was  you  
But I'm afraid...  
  
>It's too late to apologize, it's too late  
I  said it's too late to apologize, it's too late whoa.....  
  
>It's too late to  apologize, it's too late  
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too  late  
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah-  
I said it's too late to  apologize, yeah-  
I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the  ground...
