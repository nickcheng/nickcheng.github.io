[The cure - There is no if](http://lab.nickcheng.com/music/06-the_cure-there_is_no_if-tns.mp3)

这是The Cure的, There is no if. 很好听的音乐, 歌词也很好, 不过就是比较悲一些...大家自己欣赏吧:)

>_remember the first time i told you i love you -  
it was raining hard and you never heard -  
you sneezed! and i had to say it over  
i said i love you i said... you didn't say a word  
just held you hands to my shining eyes  
and i watched as the rain ran through your fingers  
held your hands to my shining eyes and smiled as you kissed me...  
if you die you said so do i you said...  
and it starts the day you make the sign  
tell me i'm forever yours and you're forever mine  
forever mine...  
if you die you said so do i you said...  
and it starts the day you cross that line  
swear i will always be yours and you'll always be mine  
you'll ways be mine  
always be mine...  
remember the last time i told you i love you -  
it was warm and safe in our perfect world -  
you yawned and i had to say it over  
i said i love you i said... you didn't say a word  
just held your hands to your shining eyes  
and i watched as the tears ran through your fingers  
held your hands to your shining eyes and cried...  
if you die you said so do i you said...  
but it ends the day you see how it is  
there is no always forever... just this...  
just this...  
if you die you said so do i you said  
but it ends the day you understand  
there is no if... just and  
there is no if... just and  
there is no if..._
