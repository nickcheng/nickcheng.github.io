之所以是"再次"是因为我忘了是不是之前已经推荐过了. Ok, 就当之前推荐过吧, 再推荐一次!

那是还在大学的时候, 混论坛很流行FTP, 所以我也在自己电脑上架了一个FTP. 我的FTP上开放了一个文件夹叫"upload", 权限设置的是所有人都可以读写, 是用来让别人给我传东西的.

某天, 在这个upload目录里, 我看到了这首歌. 当然, 我不知道是谁传的, 是不是给我的我也不知道(因为总有人用这个FTP做文件中转). 既然在我这里了, 那我当然不能客气, 于是这就是我第一次听这首歌的缘故了, 比较偶然的说.

第一次听这歌就有一种震撼的感觉, 一种被击中的感觉, 倒不是说什么身有所感, 我那时还没谈恋爱呢....=_=" 但这歌让我听的竟然有一种心碎的感觉, 太奇妙了简直. 从此我记住了一句英文:"If you die, so do I".

我把歌词放上吧, 就是一个故事:

> Remember the first time I told you "I love you"  
> It was raining hard and you never heard  
> You sneezed  
> And I had to say it over  
> I said "I love you", I said  
> You didn't say a word  
> You just held your hands  
> To my shining eyes  
> And I watched as the rain ran through your fingers  
> Held your hands  
> To my shining eyes  
> And smiled as you kissed me  
>
> " If you die", you said  
> "So do I", you said  
> And it starts the day you make the sign  
> Tell me I'm forever yours  
> And you're forever mine  
> Forever mine...  
>
> " If you die", you said  
> "So do I", you said  
> And it starts the day you cross that line  
> Swear I will always be yours  
> And you'll be always be mine  
> You'll always be mine  
> Always be mine...  
>
> Remember the last time I told you I love you  
> It was warm and safe in a perfect world  
> You yawned  
> And I had to say it over  
> I said "I love you", I said  
> You didn't say a word  
> Just held your hands  
> To your shining eyes  
> And I watched as the tears ran through your fingers  
> Held you hands  
> To your shining eyes  
> And cried  
>
> " If you die", you said  
> "So do I", you said  
> But it ends the day you see how it is   
> There is no always, forever  
> Just this  
> Just this  
>
> " If you die", you said  
> "So do I", you said  
> But it ends the day you understand  
> There is no if   
> Just end  
> There is no if   
> Just end  
> There is no if
