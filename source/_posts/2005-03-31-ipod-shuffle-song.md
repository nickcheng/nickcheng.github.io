歌词：

>Caesars Palace - Jerk it Out

>Wind me up, put me down, start me up and watch me go.  
I'll be running circles around you sooner than you know.  
A little off center and I'm out of tune.  
Just kickin this can along the avenue, but I'm alright.Cause it's easy once you know how it's done,  
and you can't stop now it's already begun,  
you feel it running through your bones.  
Then you jerk it out... when you jerk it out

>Shut up, hush your mouth,  
can't you hear you talk to loud.  
no I can't hear nothing cause I got my head up in the clouds  
I'll bite of anything that I can chew  
I'm chasing cars up and down the avenue  
but that's OK

>Chorus

>**long mid-play**

>Chorus
