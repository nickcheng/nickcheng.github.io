因为是第一期,所以只介绍3首歌曲,看看反映怎么样,看看有没有继续做下去的必要,大家有什么意见可以提,欢迎板儿砖.

另外,大家想要什么样的音乐都请提出来,我会尽量满足各位的!!

1.Darren Hayes-------I Miss You

![Darren Hayes](http://www.artistdirect.com/Images/Sources/AMGCOVERS/music/cover200/drf100/f152/f152612bwgi.jpg)

savage garden各自单飞,Darren Hayes作品先出,说句实话,买回cd初一听,感觉乱糟糟的,只这首,一下子入耳,音乐柔和，Darren的嗓音富有磁性，savage garden又回来了。

[歌词]

> Darren Hayes---I Miss You

> Gimme a reason  
> Why I'm feeling so blue  
> Everytime I close my eyes, all I see is you  
> Gimme a reason  
> Why I can't feel my heart    
> Everytime you leave my side, I just fall apart

> And when you're fast asleep, I wonder where you go  
> Can you tell me, I wanna know
> 
> Because I miss you  
> And this is all I wanna say  
> I guess I miss you, beautiful  
> These three words have said it all  
> You know I miss you  
> I think about you when you're gone  
> I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong  
> I don't need to carry on

> Gimme a reason  
> Why I can't concentrate  
> The world is turning upside down  
> Spinning round and round  
> Gimme a reason  
> Why I now understand  
> The beauty and simplicity of everything surrounding me

> You got a way of spreading magic everywhere  
> Anywhere I go, I know you're always there  
> It sounds ridiculous, but when you leave a room  
> There's a part of me that just wants to follow you too

> Because I miss you  
> And this is all I wanna say  
> I guess I miss you, beautiful  
> These three words have said it all  
> You know I miss you  
> I think about you when you're gone  
> I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong  
> I don't need to carry on

> It's such a hard life in most of the time  
> I'm just surviving  
> That's why I want you to know  
> In the world where sincerity has lost its meaning  
> You fill my world with so much hope

> And I miss you  
> This is all I wanna say  
> I guess I miss you, beautiful  
> These three words have said it all  
> You know I miss you  
> I think about you when you're gone  
> I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong  
> I don't need to carry on

> You know I miss you    
> And this all I wanna say  
> I guess I miss you, beautiful  
> These three words have said it all

> You know I miss you  
> And this is all I wanna do  
> I know it doesn't sound too cool  
> But maybe I'm in love with you

> You know I miss you  
> And this all I wanna say  
> I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong  
> I don't need to carry on

> I just miss you  
> Yeah, it's true  
> I miss you, baby  
> And when you're walking out that door  
> I know I miss you  
> You make me wanna ask for more  
> I just miss you  
> Yeah, it's true  
> I miss you, baby

2.Celine Dion------Right In Front Of You

Celine Dion的新专辑每首曲子都没的说,但我一直钟情于这首。前奏的小提琴，紧接着就是Celine的哼唱，随着歌曲的前进，她的声音一下子放开，每个环节都衔接的恰到好处。呵呵，听的都很舒畅，富有激情。

[歌词]

> Celine Dion------Right In Front Of You

> Life, it can twist your heart  
> Put you in the dark  
> I was cold and lonely  

> Doubt, it can close you in  
> Build the walls within  
> I let fear control me  
> And that girl didn't know  
> Where the answer would be

> Right in front of you  
> Right in front of me  
> We were looking for it somehow  
> Somewhere we couldn't see  
  
> But the love was always there  
> It's been around us everywhere  
> I had to fall to finally see  
> That you were right in front of me  
  
> Ummm  
  
> Faith, it can lift you up  
> And if you got enough  
> To reach a new beginning  
  
> Love, can withstand strong  
> In the final hour  
> We'll find the joy in living  
  
> Don't let go  
> Cause that I know  
> Pretty soon you will see  

> Right in front of you  
> Right in front of me  
> We were looking for it somehow  
> Somewhere we couldn't see

> But the love was always there  
> It's been around us everywhere  
> I had to fall to finally see  
> That you were right in front of me

> You are my tomorrow  
> There's safety in your arms  
> Where you'll go I'll follow  
> 'Cause you're the world where I belong

> Right in front of you  
> In front of me  
> Somehow we couldn't see  
> Right in front of you  
> I had to fall to finally see

> Right in front of you  
> Right in front of me  
> We were looking for it somehow  
> Somewhere we couldn't see

> But the love was always there  
> Surrounding us everywhere  
> I had to fall to finally see

> Right in front of you  
> Right in front of me  
> We were looking for it somehow  
> Somewhere we couldn't see

> But the love was always there  
> Surrounding us everywhere  
> I had to fall to finally see  
> That you were right in front of me

> I finally see... yeah  
> I had to fall to finally see  
> That you were right in front of me  

3.伍思凯----分享

转眼就大三了,离毕业没有多长时间了,毕了业,有好多同学都要分开了,而且以后也没什么机会再见面了,想想的确有些哀伤. 这么些年,打打闹闹,磕磕绊绊,矛矛盾盾,欢欢笑笑,就这首吧,送给我的同窗们。

[歌词]

> 伍思凯----分享

> 时间已做了选择 什么人叫做朋友  
> 偶而碰头 心情却能一点就通  
> 因为我们曾有过 理想类似的生活  
> 太多感受 绝非三言两语能形容  
> 可能有时我们顾虑太多  
> 太多决定需要我们去选择  
> 担心会犯错 难免会受挫  
> 幸好一路上有你陪我 与你分享的快乐 胜过独自拥有  
> 至今我仍深深感动  
> 好友如同一扇窗 能让视野不同  
> 与你分享的快乐 胜过独自拥有 至今我仍深深感动  
> 好友如同一扇门 让世界(变)开阔
